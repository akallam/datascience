    "## 1. Introduction: \n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook performs a proportions test using `proportions_ztest` from `statsmodels.stats.proportion` to determine if proportion of hobbyist users is the same for those under thirty as for those aged thirty and over.\n",

    "**$H_0$**: The proportion of hobbyist users is the same for those under thirty as for those aged thirty and over.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$H_a$**: The proportion of hobbyist users is not the same for the two age groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Data Source\n",
    "The dataset, `stack_overflow.feather` is from datacamp. This is available as a feather file for datacamp subscribers and expected to be placed in `../../data` folder. \n",
    "We will be using `hobbyist` column which is a `Yes, No` column. Yes representing that the user is a hobbyist, and `age_cat` column which is categorical column with values `Under 30` for users who are under 30 year old and `At least 30` for users with at least 30 years old.\n",
    "We'll use `pandas` to load the data and create two separate groups based on age: `under_thirty` and `at_least_thirty`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Import Libraries and Set Significe Level\n",
    "This step imports the necessary Python libraries and loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, and sets the significance level to 0.05\n",
    "- `pandas` is imported as pd for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- `proportions_ztest` is imported to test for proportions based on normal (z) test\n",
    "- `alpha` is set to 0.05. This is the chosen significance level, which will be used to compare against the p-value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis."
