    "## 1. Introduction: \n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook performs a proportions test using `proportions_ztest` from `statsmodels.stats.proportion` to determine if the amount paid for freight affects whether or not the shipment was late.\n",

    "### 1.1 Problem Statement\n",
    "**$H_0$**: The proportion of expensive shipments is the same for reasonable shipment for late shipments.\n",
    "\n",
    "**$H_a$**: The proportion of expensive shipments is more than reasonable shipment for late shipments.\n",

    "### 1.2 Data Source\n",
    "The dataset, `late_shipments.feather` is from datacamp. This is available as a feather file for datacamp subscribers and is expected to be placed in `../../data` folder.  \n",
    "We will be using columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "    - `late` column which is a `Yes, No` column. Yes representing that the shipment was late,  \n",
    "    - `freight_cost_groups` Freight costs are stored as categories `expensive` and `reasonable`\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Import Libraries and Set Significe Level\n",
    "This step imports the necessary Python libraries and loads the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, and sets the significance level to 0.05\n",
    "- `pandas` is imported as pd for data manipulation and analysis.\n",
    "- `proportions_ztest` is imported to test for proportions based on normal (z) test\n",
    "- `alpha` is set to 0.05. This is the chosen significance level, which will be used to compare against the p-value to decide whether to reject the null hypothesis."
